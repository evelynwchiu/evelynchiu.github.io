    In high school, I was involved with our school’s Science Scholars program which was a science research class. 
    I was involved in stroke rehabilitation research in the NYU Ambulatory Care Center, working in the Motor Recovery 
    Research Lab under Dr. Preeti Raghavan and Dr. Anna Palumbo. I researched the effectiveness of the Bimanual Arm Trainer 
    device, which helped stroke patients regain shoulder external rotation movement. This device paired a rowing video game 
    with audio, visual, and audiovisual cues and the goal of the research was to determine which cues were most effective 
    in training.

    During the summers, I got to shadow patients training with the device and conduct surveys assessing their feelings 
    of pain and strain using the device. I used Excel and MATLAB to analyze and process the data of the patients’ shoulder 
    rotation movements, in additional to their perceived strain levels. During the school year, I would read the existing 
    research and literature to help corroborate my ideas and understand the results.

    After two years in the program, in senior year I authored a paper using the data I obtained from the lab and created a 
    poster. I presented our findings at three different symposia.

    Here is the paper I authored!
