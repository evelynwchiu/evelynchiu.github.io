    Collectif Engineering PLLC is an MEP energy startup based in New York, New York. I started at Collectif Engineering 
    in the summer of 2023 as a Kessler Fellow, a fellowship that sponsors Cornell students who are interested in 
    entrepreneurship to work at a startup of their choice. I chose to work at Collectif because I was interested in 
    renewable energy systems and modular construction. Also, I wanted to learn more about understanding how financial 
    data can motivate business decisions. 
</p>

<p>
    During my time at Collectif, I had the opportunity to dive deeper into different projects the firm had. I was also 
    minorly involved in other projects that needed another pair of hands to help out. However, most of my internship 
    was structured around renewable projects, modular projects, and the creation and maintenance of the team’s 
    financial dashboard. 
</p>

<p>
    At Collectif, I got to work on a lot of interesting projects, including modular prefab construction, various 
    spas and bathhouses, citizenM hotels, and even the rebuild of a Chinese community center that had burned down 
    (which was somewhere that my grandparents had frequented!). 
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Financial Dashboard</h2>

<p>
    One of my largest projects (spanning throughout the year I spent there!) was creating a financial dashboard. 
    I created three dashboards – one that tracked company growth, a second that tracked how certain projects were 
    doing, and a third that tracked how employees were working across projects. 
</p>

<p>
    I used SQL to parse through spreadsheets on a platform called Zoho Analytics. I used spreadsheets that tracked the 
    company’s account, accrual transactions, customers, invoicing data, employee information, expenses, projects, and 
    timesheets to put together this table. On the main financial dashboard tracking the company’s growth, I created 
    graphs and widgets that tracked cash metrics like revenue and expenses of the company throughout its four years 
    of operation. The project dashboard I created allowed users to track the project multipliers, profit margins, and 
    hours of labor spent on the project, and compared it to other projects they had done with a similar market sector 
    and size. These dashboards allowed the company principals to plan for the future including planning their fees for 
    future projects, figure out the future direction of the company, and deciding which projects and customers were the 
    most beneficial for the company. The employee dashboard tracked how employees spent their time, letting the principals 
    figure out internal inefficiencies, how to allocate their internal resources on projects, and help employees balance 
    their workload. 
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Energy Modeling and Research</h2>

<p>
    Across multiple high-rise hotel projects, I was involved in conducting research and creating models to minimize the 
    building’s energy use and consumption. I did this using either eQuest or CBECC-Com software, which allowed me to 
    analyze the construction of the building. This included looking at the construction materials, heating and cooling 
    systems, water heating system, predicted electrical loads, and the lighting, and inputting them into the model. 
    We tried different systems in this model to determine which would be the most energy-efficient and compliant and 
    compiled these results into reports to present to the client. I got to work with the energy systems across 
    constructions that were both new and existing, which taught me how to propose new ideas but also fix existing ones. 
</p>

<p>
    In one project I worked on in its early stages, I researched several systems, including using solar heating, methane 
    or hydrogen-powered fuel cells, geothermal power, and wind power to reduce the carbon footprint of these buildings. 
    I authored a report presenting my findings and the different options of energy that could be used, explaining the pros 
    and cons of each and recommending which systems would operate the best given the environmental conditions and building use. 
</p>

<p>
    In another project that was existing, the clients were having trouble with their cooling systems. I got to analyze
    an existing system that wasn’t working and create my own formulations based on my research to explain why and 
    recommend solutions to their problem.
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Cassette Systems</h2>

<p>
    Cassette Systems is a modular prefab home company. I was heavily involved in this project, as I had gotten my 
    internship at Collectif by connecting with Cassette first. 
</p>

<p>
    I was involved in designing the MEP systems in the prefab unit, working closely with the MEP design team at Collectif 
    and the founders of Cassette to ensure that the design met the functional and architectural requirements of the home. 
    I also worked with members of the procurement and supply chain team to determine if the products we selected would be 
    able to be produced within the prefab home. Due to an NDA, I cannot provide more specifics about the work that I did. 
</p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Bathhouse</h2>

<p>
    I helped design the water heating loop for the Bathhouse in Williamsburg. I learned how to calculate hydronic 
    pipe pressure and pipe GPM to inform how water moves through the loop. I also learned about how to write a sequence 
    of operations control reports of a system. This allowed me to help draft the water heating loop diagram and piping 
    plan in AutoCAD. This project was interesting because it involved using water heaters that mine Bitcoin while 
    producing heat, which taught me how to use novel inventions and developments to guide my design choices.
