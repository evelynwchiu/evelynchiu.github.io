    MAE 2250: Mechanical Synthesis is a course for sophomores at Cornell focused on teaching the fundamentals of mechanical design. 
    We had two major projects: designing a water pump that could pump at least 1L/min, and designing a new product to exhibit user-centric design.
</p>

<h3>User-Centric Design</h3>

<p>
    My partner and I designed a sewing machine guard rail for sewers to be able to use a sewing machine without the fear of 
    clipping their finger with the needle. This was aimed to help young sewers, sewers with mobility issues, and elderly sewers.

<p>
    We were selected one of the “Best of Design” projects and we got to present our project and demonstrate its use to the class of 175 students!

<h3>Water Pump</h3>

<p>
    Myself and 5 other students worked to design and manufacture a peristaltic water pump. The entire project was completed over 
    the course of 3 weeks, with a limited material and budget. I was involved in the assembly of our water pump. Our pump was 
    able to deliver 2.75L in one minute, which was one of the best in our lab section!
