    This project is in the works! The Sustainable Mobility Shelter Project will be my MEng project throughout the next year. 
</p>

<p>
    This project aims to create a sustainable bus shelter for students on campus that encourages public transportation. 
    This bus shelter is composed of triangular modular pieces that fit together like a puzzle to construct the shelter. 
    The shelter aims to protect commuters from harsh weather conditions in Ithaca when waiting for the bus and provides an 
    aesthetically pleasing and unique shelter to various locations on campus and across the Ithaca community. The shelter 
    lights up to communicate the proximity of the bus and is fully sustainable.

    I will be working on the CAD model and the prototype of the triangular modular pieces that compose of the larger 
    structure. Around November, I will help the team construct the alpha prototype that will be placed on campus to do 
    ser testing.
